See the future of your Magic: The Gathering tournament

Omniscience takes the current state of a Magic: The Gathering tournament you're in (one that is using the official Companion app for tracking) and simulates thousands of possible results at random. From this, you can know what your odds are of making it into the top 8 of a tournament if you win/lose/draw. 

### Features

1. **Can I draw in?**

    If you're in the last round of an event, Omniscience will tell you the odds of making top 8 for you AND your opponent for each result of Win / Loss / Draw. It's important to include your opponent in this calculation, since you're only going to shake hands if you both are safe to draw in. IE: You may be locked at 100% for top 8 with a draw, but if your opponent is at 0% with a draw... then they're going to make you play it out!

2. **Should I drop?**

    If you're in the middle of an event, Omniscience will tell you the odds of making top 8 if you win the rest of your matches. This can let you know if you're locked out of top 8 and should drop. 

3. **Automatically pulls tournament data**

    All you need to do is log in with your M:tG Companion app credentials, and Omniscience will pull down all the details of the tournament you're in automatically. 

### FAQ

1. **What platform can I use Omniscience on?**

    Android and iOS are supported. Omniscience is written in React Native, which technically can make a local Web application, but this does not work since your browser will refuse to make cross-origin HTTP requests. Non-browser native apps do not adhere to the Same-Origin Policy, and so those work just fine.

2. **Why do I have to enter my Companion app credentials?**

    Omniscience hooks into the Companion backend to pull down tournament data. In order to get the event data, you have to be authenticated as a user in the event. That's why.

3. **Is this gonna steal my password or something?**

    No. Omniscience is Free and Open Source software. There's no ads, no spyware, no tracking. It is what it seems and no more.

4. **I just want to play around with Omniscience, how can I do that without going to a tournament?**

    You host your own dummy event using the official M:tG Companion app. Just click on the Host tab in the middle and start up an event and add some dummy players to it and record results. 

5. **How guaranteed are the percentages that Omniscience makes?**

    Omniscience works by simulating thousands of possible event outcomes at random. For even medium-sized events, this means that there's billions (if not in fact way more) of possible distinct outcomes per round. We can't simulate all of them. If Omniscience simulates 1,000 events and you make top 8 in all 1,000 simulations, it will report the percentage as 100%. But that doesn't mean there couldn't POSSIBLY be some exceedingly rare scenario lurking in the immense possibility space that we didn't happen to land on. So the numbers should be interpreted as approximations rather than mathematical certainties. In practice, it ought to be rigorous enough to base decisions on. 

### Assumptions

Omniscience makes a few assumptions about the nature of your event in order to calculate odds. If any of these assumptions are broken, then wierd things can happen that are hard to account for:

1. Players act in their own rational best interest. (IE: Drawing in when they're locked to do so)
2. Players don't collude.
3. There is a static unintentional draw rate that will always occur. (Default is 1%)
4. Players are unaware of the results of other matches. (IE: Prisoner's dilemmas)
5. The format of your event is a Swiss bracket with a cut to top 8. 
6. All players are equally likely to win a match. (Omniscience isn't going to account for the fact that Reid Duke is in the event)

### Building from Source / Running on Expo

Omniscience is written in React Native, so building it should be as simple as `yarn` and then `yarn start`. You should then be able to pull the app up using the Expo Go app. Setting up Expo is beyond the scope of this readme, but it's pretty simple and Googleable. 

### UI Help
You can probably tell that I'm not a UI designer. If you are, and liked Omniscience, then please help out making the UI prettier. Thanks!
